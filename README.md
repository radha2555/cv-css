README for HTML Linked with Different Websites

This project contains an HTML file with links to different websites. The HTML file contains a simple structure with a header, main content section, and a footer.

The links are added to the main content section of the HTML file. Each link is added using the `<a>` tag with the `href` attribute pointing to the URL of the website.

To use this project, simply download the HTML file and open it in a web browser. Clicking on any of the links to open a website. I have also made a form inside of a
website to print and send it to me.
The website still lacks a backend server.
